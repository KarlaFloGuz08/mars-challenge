# Mars-challenge

## Background

You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

## What You're Creating

This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

The data was analyzed to answer the following questions:

- How many months exist on Mars? 12 months. 
- How many Martian days' worth of data are there? There are 1867 Martian days' worth of data in the scraped dataset.

 ## Analysis 
 
- The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer: 

- Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?

- Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?

- How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate of 25% was made.

Minimum Temperature
After the analysis, it is found that Month #8 had the hottest average temperature of -68.38ºC and Month #3 had the coldest average temperature of -83.31ºC

Atmospheric Pressure
The lowest pressure is found in month: 6 (Pressure: 745.05) and the highest pressure is found in month: 9 (Pressure: 913.31).

Year Length
There is a peak around 690-740 and another around 1375-1425. Therefore, one Martian year is around 685 terrestrial days in the plot. The literature confirms that Martian year length is 687.
